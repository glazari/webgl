# Build

The index.html references a javascript file that is generated by webpack. To build this file, run:

```bash
npm install

npx webpack
```

# Development server

Because the javascript file reads an image
there is a CORS issue when running the index.html file directly from the file system.
So, to run the index.html file, you need to run a development server.
To run a development server, run:

```bash
npx http-server
```
